# Smart Wheelchair Control Based on Spatial Features of Hand Gesture.

ðŸš€Collaborating with Rasyeedah binti Mohd Othman, this project involves training a CNN model with a dataset of hand movement pose. Real time predicted pose will then used to control wheelchair movement.

## Demo

## Installation
Please use seperate folder for training and control. venv setup for training

```bash
  python --version
  python -m venv nama_venv
  nama_venv\Scripts\activate
  pip install opencv-python
  pip install mediapipe
  pip install numpy
  pip install matplotlib
  pip install tensorflow
```
The training file include process of collecting dataset. Please modify for each class image data folder. Example :
```bash
  CreateDataSet(0, "Berhenti", DirektoriDataSet)
```
Actually, you need an ESP32 and the wheelchair to run it.

```bash
  python --version
  python -m venv nama_venv
  nama_venv\Scripts\activate
  pip install mediapipe
  pip install opencv-python
```
    
## Features

- Optimized hand gestures for controlling the wheelchair.
- A lightweight and user-friendly system.
